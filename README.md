# Push

Push is a governance focused devops tool designed to solve the complicated needs regulation applies to organizations.

In development I am directly using auth0 for simplicity. Once the project is closer to completion I will figure something else out.
Probably using a standalone service to handle auth and federating with whatever is folks want to use.
